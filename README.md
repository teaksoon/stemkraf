Sources codes are in .zip files, you can download them and run them on your computer.

Some of the Programs in this page may use STEMKRAF libraries, so you may need to install the Libraries in order to run those Programs.
Currently there is only Library for the SSD1306 OLED i2c Module (64x128pixel only ). libsk_c_oled.h and libsk_g_oled.h. Instruction on how to install the library is inside both files.
